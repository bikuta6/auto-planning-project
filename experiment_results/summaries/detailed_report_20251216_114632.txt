=== FAST DOWNWARD EXPERIMENT REPORT ===
Generated on: 2025-12-16 11:46:33
Time Limit: 1800 seconds
Domains Tested: darksouls-fd
Planners Tested: lama-first lama fdss-opt

=== PLANNER CONFIGURATIONS ===
- lama-first: LAMA planner with unit costs, returns first solution found
  Command: --alias lama-first
- lama: Full LAMA planner from IPC'11 satisficing track
  Command: --alias seq-sat-lama-2011
- fdss-opt: FDSS optimal planner from IPC'11 optimal track
  Command: --alias seq-opt-fdss-1

=== COVERAGE ANALYSIS ===

Domain: darksouls-fd
----------------------------------------
lama-first     : 12/12 solved (100%)
lama           : 12/12 solved (100%)
fdss-opt       : 12/12 solved (100%)

=== ANALYSIS TIPS FOR YOUR REPORT ===
1. Coverage Comparison: Compare solved/total ratios across planners
2. Runtime Analysis: Analyze timing differences between planners
3. Plan Quality: Compare plan length and cost metrics
4. Search Efficiency: Compare expanded/generated nodes ratios
5. Domain-Specific Performance: Analyze performance per domain

=== METRICS EXPLANATION ===
- Solved: YES/NO/TIMEOUT/OUT_OF_MEMORY/NO_SOLUTION/CRITICAL_ERROR/FAILED
- Total_Time(s): Complete execution time including translation
- Plan_Length: Number of actions in the solution
- Plan_Cost: Total cost of the plan
- Expanded_Nodes: States expanded during search
- Generated_Nodes: States generated during search
- Exit_Code: Fast Downward's exit code

=== EXIT CODE MEANINGS ===
- 0: SUCCESS (clean solution found)
- 2: PARTIAL SUCCESS (portfolio found solution despite some component failures)
- 23: TIMEOUT (time limit exceeded)
- 30: OUT OF MEMORY (memory limit exceeded)
- 32: NO SOLUTION (search completed but no solution exists)
- 1: CRITICAL ERROR (translation failed, invalid input, etc.)

=== EXPECTED RESULTS ===
- LAMA-first: Fast, may find suboptimal solutions, exit codes 0/2
- LAMA: Balanced speed/quality, satisficing solutions, exit codes 0/2
- FDSS-opt: Slower optimal planner, more likely timeouts (exit code 23)
